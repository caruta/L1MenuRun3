**Comment:** Menu of November 2021 Trigger Review for Run3, with additional seeds starting from L1_DoubleJet_110_35_DoubleJet35_Mass_Min620, monitoring the exclusive contribution from barrel (#367), HE (#368) and HF(#369) for rate checks [Scale set reference, for grammar version 0.9]

**NOTE:** The default behavior of the script sets the prescales of seeds using NotBptx or Bptx to zero. This is due to problems emulating NotBptx in ZeroBias. If you wish to include the prescale information for these seeds, use the --includeBptx option.
